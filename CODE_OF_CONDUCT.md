# Contributor Code of Conduct

As maintainers, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes to the project by providing feedback, posting issues & comments, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or any other activities. We promise to extend equal treatment to every individual involved regardless of gender, identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity or religion, and expect a similar solidarity against discrimination from our community.

Communication must never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct. If any member of the community violates this code, the maintainers of the project may take action, removing issues, comments, and PRs or blocking accounts as deemed appropriate.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please do not hesitate to contact the project maintainers directly.
