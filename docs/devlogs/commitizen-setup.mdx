# References

As starters we will integrate the tools below to structure our commits. Keeping track of the scope of our contributions will later come in handy as we prepare our changelogs.

- [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) for conventional commits
- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) for pre-commit hooks

# Commit Structure

Using the command `pnpm run commit` instead of `git commit` will invoke the git-cz cli tool and guide you through providing the necessary details for your commit.

Configuration files are located at the root of our repo. Listed options for commit types and scope can be updated via the contents of `.cz-config.js`.

{% embeddedCode
filePath="../../.cz-config.js"
/%}

# Conventional Commmits Preset

Preset rules by `@commitlint/config-conventional` can be overridden using the file `commitlint.config.js`.
