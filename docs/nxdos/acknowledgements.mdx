## Message to the community

Comments from fellow developers, small teams and especially solo-founders are immensely valuable for us. We'll do our best to get back in touch with you the soonest we can, and are genuinely interested to find out more about your specific needs.

Whether you would like to contribute, share some thoughts or make suggestions for enhancements, please refer to the issues section of our repo first. As the project is in earlier stages of its development, if you don't find a relevant issue feel free to open a new one.

We'd much appreciate help and advise from community members experienced in developing or maintaining open-source projects.

## Guidelines

In order to implement changes simply fork our repo, clone it to your local, and dive in as described by the [getting started](/getting-started) section. A more in depth document will follow in the future to clearly highlight guidelines for contributing.

If you are planning to submit a PR, make sure to open an issue first describing the changes you want to make, and open a pull request only when your suggestions get approved.

Commits are expected to abide by the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) guidelines and prepend the relevant scope i.e. `feat:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, etc, before to its title.
