# Let's JAM

Jamstack community elevates three pillars as the basis of modern web development architecture;

- Javascript
- APIs
- Markdown

## What's Jamstack?

Nx-DOS is heavily inspired by the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) community. For those who might not be familiar, below is an excerpt from their description as to "What is Jamstack?"

> Jamstack is an architectural approach that decouples the web experience layer from data and business logic, improving flexibility, scalability, performance, and maintainability.

As [another website](https://umbraco.com/knowledge-base/jamstack/) describes it;

> Jamstack is a term that describes a modern web development architecture based on JavaScript, APIs, and Markdown (JAM). Jamstack isn't a specific technology or framework but a different architecture for building apps and websites.

## Why is this important?

Nx-DOS supports an unopiniated approach and encourages developers to plug-in their preferred solutions, especially regarding the frontend frameworks and 3rd party APIs. There are many viable alternatives to each part of the stack highlighted throughout this documentation.

Following the Jamstack principles, Nx-DOS is a self documenting project. The segments you are currently reading are maintained using markdown documents, rendered by libraries like [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/) / [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) and hosted via [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) to benefit from the framework's SSR and SEO capabilities.

## How to use Nx-DOS?

Our aim is to provide preset configurations for all three of these pillars for reference, which developers can modify to suit their needs.

- Regarding Javacsript frameworks, we will establish shared UI foundations using; React + React Native for targeting multiple platforms.
- In terms of API usage, we will showcase examples for common use cases and rely on community support for further 3rd party integrations.
- Maintaining documentation will rely on our manual content review.

In order to benefit from Nx-DOS, after cloning or forking our repo, modify the `/docs` directory to include references to your development. The contents within will be parsed automatically each time you start the server. 

Further details are available on [how to configure documentation segments](/configuration/documentation).
