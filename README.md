<hr>

Nx-DOS is a project inspired by the [monorepo management tool Nx](https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro).

It's a starter template for small teams and solo founders to help build their online businesses. Our main objective is to save time, effort and costs for developers in the seed stage.

## Pre-release disclaimer

Please note this repo is under development and doesn't currently include a generator to create a copy of the template application using a CLI command. Pending a beta release, please manually duplicate the sample application to modify as you need.

# Special Thanks

Nx is the unifying tool in the center of this project. It allows us automation and control over our monorepo in order to encourage design patterns cherished by the dev community. It will be a powerful tool in our palette with immediate practical benefits and time savings.

# Nx - general usage instructions

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev). Usage instructions about Nx are referenced below regarding basic tasks, for further details please refer to official Nx documentation. While developing and maintaining clones of this repo, it's suggested to follow Nrwl's guidelines and Nx community channels on Nx best practices.

## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

## Generate an application

Run `nx g @nx/react:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `nx g @nx/react:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@nxdos/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `nx serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `nx g @nx/react:component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `nx e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
